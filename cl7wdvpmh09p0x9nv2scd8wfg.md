## Cracking the Coding Interview - 1

As a senior engineering student, I recently started looking for a job and internship. Some of the interviews I had last year went very well and I got a job offer, but we couldn't get along due to personal reasons. I was eliminated in the final stages of some of my interviews and the early stages of others. I realized what my mistakes and shortcomings were and wanted to correct them.

While surfing on Twitter, I came across Madison Kanna's tweet.

[**Cracking the Coding Interview**](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) was a book I always wanted to read, but I had no motivation. I joined the Discord Server and Code Book Club became my motivation. I'm happy to see users reading the same book as me at the same time. 

Madison Kanna and this discord host also got me started on this blog. I saw an article written about Learning In Public by @[Melody Menzies](@melodymdev). I thought that this method would also be effective in my learning process and I started this blog. 

On this [blog page](https://madisonkanna.com/crackingthecodinginterview/), you can find out which days and which pages we will work on. This week we should read pages 1-38 of this book. I am writing this article to write down the notes I took in these pages and what I learned from these pages.

Let's get started!

This chapter was about general topics. These topics are *the interview process*, *the most popular companies' interviews*, *writing resumes*, and do's or don'ts. 

Not every interview goes well, or responses may be late. In these and similar situations, it is necessary to be friendly and patient. If there is a late response, we can send a friendly e-mail.

Recruiters pay attention to our analytics, social and coding capabilities. We need to explain ourselves correctly and properly to the interviewer on these issues. Personally, I think I have a problem with this. In the book, example sentences and a template are given for such situations.

In this template, you need to write down the projects you took part in and the roles you took in these projects, the mistakes and difficulties you made in the project. If you review this template before the interview day, it will help you remember your past experiences. I'm thinking of editing this template for my past projects. I think it will be useful.

One of the things I will change after reading the book is my resume. I realized that I could not express myself adequately in my resume and I did not use the fields efficiently.

This post was a little short because it didn't include coding, but please expose me as it's my first post.

You can see the short notes I took while reading these pages in the image below.

Next week we will be interviewing with a company that I would love to work for. I hope it goes well for me. Wish me luck! ðŸ˜Š
